# WP Engine

WP Engine is a reliable, managed hosting platform for WordPress sites. While it isnâ€™t free, the security, maintenance, and reliability benefits justify the cost.

1. Go to [WP Engine Signup](https://my.wpengine.com/signup?plan=startup). You should be on the "Startup" plan, which is good for a single site.
2. Choose monthly or annual billing.
3. No additional sites are needed.
4. Check the Smart Plugin Manager (definitely worth the $10/month cost)
5. Leave the other add-ons unchecked
6. Enter your email. Name the account `{WPEngine Account Name}`. Datacenter location can stay in US. Enter your first/last name.
7. Fill out billing information, check Accept Terms and click Create my Site button.
8. You should now be logged in to the Portal.
9. Click **Users** in the top menu.
10. Click the **Add User** button in the upper right
11. Invite me: `{WP Engine Invite Name}`, `{WP Engine Invite Email}`, `{WP Engine Invite Phone}`, and select **Owner** for account access.

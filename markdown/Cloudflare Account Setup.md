# Cloudflare

Cloudflare does a number of things, but we are interested in using it to help with site security and performance. They offer a free tier, which should be all we need.

1. Go to [https://www.cloudflare.com](https://www.cloudflare.com/) and click Sign Up in the header.
2. Walk through the sign up process, but you do not need to add a site/domain. Just establish the account and I can do the actual setup.
3. It may ask for a credit card, but I will notify you if we ever need to switch from the free plan in the future.
4. Once your account is setup, click the Members tab and invite me using `{Cloudfront email}`

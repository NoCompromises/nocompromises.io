# Github

Github is responsible for hosting all our source code, and is also a useful project management tool. Individual users can create a free account with their name, and we also need to purchase an Organization for the team as a whole.

## Individual User Account

Each user should have their own free account. This is useful for managing permissions, having conversations, assigning tasks and so on. If you don't already have a Github account, create one using the following steps.

1. Go to [Github Signup](https://github.com/join?plan=free)
2. Pick a username that makes it easy to identify you (ideally, your real name)
3. Click through and confirm you've picked the Free plan
4. Complete the process and verify your email address by clicking the link in the email they sent.

## Organization Account

The company should also have a dedicated Organization account. This is a paid account, but it's important for proper team/permission management.

1. Once logged in with your individual user account, [follow these steps to setup a new organization](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-organizations-and-teams/creating-a-new-organization-from-scratch).
1. Give the organization a meaningful name (ideally your company's name)
1. Pick the Free plan.
1. Invite `{Github Invite Email}` to the Organization.
1. I'll contact you once I've accepted the invitation, then you can change my Role from Member to Owner.

      <ul>
        <li>Do you feel like you're always behind?</li>
        <li>Does your team spend more time fixing bugs than shipping new features?</li>
        <li>Are you losing customers because your app is too slow? Do you make excuses during a demo because of how slow
          it is?</li>
        <li>Is your product stuck on an old version of Laravel or PHP because youâ€™re too afraid to upgrade and break
          something? Is your team held hostage by your current hosting provider?</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>There is a better way?</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Your projects are done on time and you even pay down technical debt along the way.</li>
        <li>Most of your time is spent building new things instead of fixing old bugs.</li>
        <li>Customers enjoy using your product and you take pride in building a well-performing app.</li>
        <li>By staying current your team gets to use the newest Laravel and PHP features.</li>

      <h2>Accept No Compromises</h2>
      <p>
        Your problems are painful, but not unique. Many teams face these same challenges. Introducing a fresh
        perspective can help your team break out of this rut. We've worked with many Laravel teams to solve these exact
        pains. No Compromises isn't just another set of hands. When we join a team, we do more than just close tickets
        and write code. We make your team and product better.

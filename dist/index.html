          <p>
            Your problems are painful, but not unique. Many teams face these
            same challenges. Introducing a fresh perspective can help your
            team break out of this rut. We've worked with many Laravel teams
            to solve these exact pains. No Compromises isn't just another set
            of hands. When we join a team, we do more than just close tickets
            and write code. We make your team and product better.

The best part is they also suggested a better way to handle our complex problem, rather than over-engineer it. This 60 minute call saved us thousands of dollars, and a lot of wasted time.</blockquote>

          <h2>Common Questions</h2>
          <dl>
            <dt>
              You say you make our product and team better. What does
              <q>better</q> actually mean?
            </dt>
            <dd>
              <p>
                We make your product better, not just by building features and
                fixing bugs, but by continually improving the code base:
                making code easier to understand, writing tests to build
                confidence, and creating useful documentation.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-0">
                We make your team better through open communication: investing
                time in constructive code review, pair programming, and
                helping translate technical needs to business outcomes.
              </p>

            <dt>Why would I want some outsider like you?</dt>
            <dd>
              It's already tough to get everything done. Bringing in outside
              help to introduce new best practices saves time, especially
              since this is all we do. Plus, you can use our unbiased
              expertise to make a stronger case with management that investing
              in quality now will pay dividends.
            </dd>

              We're already behind, won't adding more people slow things down?

            <dd>
              Since we've worked on many projects, we're very quick to get up
              to speed. Yes, we'll need your help with some initial setup, but
              we aren't going to waste your time with a lot of silly
              questions. We've also built tools over the years that make this
              whole process easier.
            </dd>

            <dt>
              I'm sold, but I don't make the final decision. Can you help
              convince my boss?
            </dt>

              We totally understand! You set up the call and we can do the

          <h2>What's with the name No Compromises?</h2>
          <p>
            Developers really want to build something they're proud of, but
            they often feel forced into making compromises. Joel also felt
            that way for several years before deciding to take a stand. This
            meant striking out on his own and starting No Compromises, with
            the guiding principle of only doing projects the right way. This
            doesn't mean he's stubborn, it just means he cares about building
            quality software.
          </p>

          <p>
            Aaron had many years of corporate experience leading teams with a
            focus on best practices. While running the local PHP user group
            together, they realized something. Joel's "no compromise" attitude
            with Aaron's best practice mindset and attention to detail was a
            perfect match.
          </p>

          <p>
            We're proud to do the right thing. We want to bring that to your
            team.
